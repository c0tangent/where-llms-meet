# Where LLMs Meet

LLM powered NPC chat solver.

Please read [setup](./docs/QUICKSTART.md) and [usage](./docs/USAGE.md) in `docs/` first.

## Legality

This application does not interfere or interact with `wwm.exe` in any way.  
It takes a screenshot of the app, OCR's the screenshot, send the resulting text to an LLM, then puts the response into your clipboard.  
These are all actions that a human can perform by themselves.

The [devs are vague](https://www.wherewindsmeetgame.com/news/official/BanReport.html) on what constitutes illegal tools:

> Violations include, but are not limited to: cheating, speed hacks, macro tools, or any other software that disrupts fair play.

However, instrument playing tools (basically an advanced keyboard macro) have not been banned and have been in use for quite a long time by the CN community.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ISSUES.
